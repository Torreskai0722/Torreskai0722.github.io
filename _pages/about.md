<!-- ## About Me -->

I am a Research Fellow in the [Real-Time Computing Laboratory](https://rtcl.eecs.umich.edu/rtclweb/) at the University of Michigan, working with Prof. [Kang G. Shin](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kgshin/) (ACM/IEEE Fellow). Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Wayne State University in May 2023, where I was supervised by Prof. [Weisong Shi](https://www.weisongshi.org/) (IEEE Fellow). Throughout my research career, I've had the privilege of collaborating with leading researchers from Argonne National Laboratory, IBM Research, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Inceptio, and Autoware.

## Research Focus

My research focuses on building **safe**, **predictable**, and **energy-efficient** ML systems for safety-critical **cyber-physical systems (CPS)** — from autonomous driving to robotics and beyond. I develop novel **cross-layer** systems (model/algorithms, middleware system, operating system, etc.) to achieve these goals. I'm particularly interested in:
