I'm a Research Fellow working at University of Michigan, [Real-Time Computing Laboratory (RTCL)](https://rtcl.eecs.umich.edu/rtclweb/), under Prof. [Kang G. Shin](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kgshin/). I did my PhD at Wayne State University's Connected and Autonomous Research Lab (CAR), working with Prof. [Weisong Shi](https://www.weisongshi.org/).

My research is at the intersection of [Autonomous Driving and Computing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14349).

**Current focus:** Safe & predictable ML systems for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs).
