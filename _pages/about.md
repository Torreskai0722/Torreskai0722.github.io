## About Me

I am a Research Fellow in the [Real-Time Computing Laboratory](https://rtcl.eecs.umich.edu/rtclweb/) at the University of Michigan, working with Prof. [Kang G. Shin](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kgshin/) (ACM/IEEE Fellow). My research focuses on building **safe**, **predictable**, and **energy-efficient** cyber-physical systems for autonomous vehicles and mobile robots.

## Research Focus

My work sits at the intersection of [Autonomous Driving and Computing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14349), where I develop novel approaches to ensure the reliability and efficiency of autonomous systems in real-world environments. I'm particularly interested in:

- **Safety-critical systems** for autonomous vehicles
- **Real-time computing** architectures for robotics
- **Energy optimization** in mobile autonomous systems
- **Predictable performance** guarantees for cyber-physical systems

## Background

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Wayne State University in May 2023, where I was supervised by Prof. [Weisong Shi](https://www.weisongshi.org/) (IEEE Fellow). Throughout my research career, I've had the privilege of collaborating with leading researchers from Argonne National Laboratory, IBM Research, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Inceptio, and Autoware.
